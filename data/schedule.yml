  Title: When everyone attacks
  Abstract: What happens when many people try to attack or influence AI systems simultaneously? I'll examine this question through three lenses. First, I'll discuss why popular collective defense tools against AI fail to deliver on their promises. Second, I'll discuss some dynamics that may emerge when multiple attackers try to steer an AI system to their benefit. Finally, I'll sketch a more optimistic vision: what if instead of attacking AI systems, we deployed AI that genuinely represents our interests and acts as an intermediary between ourselves and digital content?

  Title: Who Owns Robustness? Repurposing Adversarial Tools for Human Agency
  Abstract: Five years ago, we introduced Protective Optimization Technologies (POTs), a proposal that—alongside a wave of theoretical and practical work on algorithmic collective action—reflected a broader ambition to leverage adversarial tools for good, equipping collectives to contest optimization systems from the outside. Such interventions, however, face fundamental limitations, as the defensive arms race structurally favors the system owner. To bypass these limits, we argue that an effective path forward for purely technical adversarial approaches is to repurpose the toolbox from evasion to audit. We demonstrate how to build practical tools that enable external parties to verify whether systems preclude access or lack the responsiveness necessary for human agency—detecting, for instance, when a credit scoring system inevitably denies an applicant, or when an organ transplant risk model fails to prioritize a patient regardless of their deterioration.

  Title: Studying the Impacts of Automated Welfare: Why Politics and Power Matter
  Abstract: Automation too often occurs without investigations of impact, consultation and ensuring rights of refusal. This is despite the significant body of research demonstrating how automated decision making systems have led to harm by increasing discrimination, inequity, injustice, surveillance and wrongful denial of services. Our collective experiences with automation are influenced by the ubiquity of data collection, processing and profiling across our social, political and economic lives. This latest digital turn has meant unprecedented power and wealth for the owners of the largest tech companies whose decision-making influences our democratic institutions and information ecosystems, as well as our social and environmental well-being. This paper argues that our futures depend on our ability to contend with the power dynamics intersecting our datafied lives. Drawing on transnational case study investigations, I suggest that doing so requires a focus on the impacts of automation, learning from people working to prevent harm and mobilizing collective actions.

  Title: AI for Worker Collective Action
  Abstract: In today's dynamic gig economy, workers on platforms like Upwork, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and Toloka face daunting labor challenges. Despite the potential of collective action to significantly improve these conditions, its implementation is hindered by inadequate systems for identifying and resolving issues. During my keynote, I will unveil my Innovative A.I. For Worker Collective Action framework, deeply embedded in social theories. This talk will highlight how we can harness Large Language Models (LLMs), coupled with social theories and worker-owned data, to develop technologies that are truly worker-centric. These technologies not only empower workers to shape their own futures but also enhance their working conditions and address existing harms. I will showcase case studies that exemplify the practical application of this framework, illustrating its potential to revolutionize the future of work. The session will culminate in a forward-looking discussion on a research agenda aimed at exploring the societal impacts of A.I. and crafting effective socio-technical solutions that consistently put worker wellbeing at the forefront.
