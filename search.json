    "text": "About the workshop\nDespite opening up unthought opportunities for productivity and commercial development, increasingly capable algorithmic systems have also posed new threats to the well-being of their participants and lead to or exacerbated existing social issues such as biases, labor tensions (Marcin 2019; Wood and Lehdonvirta 2019), and erosion of privacy (Papernot et al. 2018). As a result, those who interact with algorithmic systems have led coordinated campaigns to shape the systems directly or pressure the operators to indirectly implement changes to the systems. Real world examples include the #DeclineNow campaign by Doordash gig workers to increase pay by collectively witholding labor, the use of coordinated “No AI Art” posts by artists on DeviantArt to voice their grievances to the platform, and the coordinated migration of users from X (Twitter) to BlueSky. We refer to (Sigg, Hardt, and Mendler-Dünner 2025) for a living survey of docmumented use cases. These bottom-up efforts demonstrate the organic interests of workers, consumers, and citizens in shaping and pushing back against algorithmic systems.\nThe study of “collective action” has a long history in Economics and Sociology as a way for groups of people to impact markets and the political arena (Olson 1965; Marwell and Oliver 1993). Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA) is the study of such coordination strategies in algorithmically-mediated sociotechnical systems. Following early explorations in HCI and Computational Social Science (Postmes and Brunsting 2002; Turner et al. 2005; Li et al. 2018), ACA has recently emerged as an exciting new topic for rigorous theoretical and empirical work within Machine Learning (Kulynych et al. 2020; Hardt et al. 2023; Ben-Dov et al. 2024; Baumann and Mendler-Dünner 2024; Gauthier, Bach, and Jordan 2025; Solanki et al. 2025). Initial findings demonstrate how the expertise of the ML community in algorithm design and optimization can be used, not only to build increasingly powerful systems, but also to enable community participation and counter power centralization though the conscious use of data interfaces in AI systems. Moreover, the user-centric perspective of ACA complements the many ongoing efforts of building “fair”, “participatory”, and “responsible” AI systems from within firms.\nOur workshop offers a platform to discuss new ideas and help define the foundational research directions for this emerging topic through interdisciplinary discussions between core ML researchers, scholars from the social sciences, community stakeholders and advocates. We will invite speakers and panelists involved in organizing communities to share practical insights and real world challenges, as well as researchers exploring related technical questions within the core ML community. Ultimately our goal is to build a lasting community and promote exciting opportunities for new research, centering the needs of consumers and workers in the study of AI systems.\n\n\n\nSpeakers\n\n\n\n\n\n Tijana Zrnic \n\n\nIncoming Assistant Professor\n\n\nStanford University\n\n\n\n\n\n Seda Gürses \n\n\nAssociate Professor\n\n\nTU Delft\n\n\n\n\n\n Florian Tramèr \n\n\nAssistant Professor\n\n\nETH Zürich\n\n\n\n\n\n Alex Hanna \n\n\nDirector of Research\n\n\nDistributed AI Research Institute (DAIR)\n\n\n\n\n\n Joanna Redden \n\n\nAssociate Professor\n\n\nWestern University\n\n\n\n\n\n Saiph Savage \n\n\nAssistant Professor\n\n\nNortheastern University\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\nOrganisers\n\n\n\n\n\n Elliot Creager \n\n\nUniversity of Waterloo\n\n\n\n\n\n Nicholas Vincent \n\n\nSimon Fraser University\n\n\n\n\n\n Celestine Mendler-Dünner \n\n\nELLIS Institute Tübingen\n\n\n\n\n\n William Agnew \n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\n\n Hanlin Li \n\n\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\n\n\n\n\n\n Ulrich Aïvodji \n\n\nÉcole de Technologie Supérieure\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\nReviewers\n\n\n\nElliot Creager — U of Waterloo\n\n\nNicholas Vincent — Simon Fraser U\n\n\nCelestine Mendler-Dünner — MPI Tübingen\n\n\nWilliiam Agnew — CMU\n\n\nHanlin Li — U of Texas\n\n\nUlrich Aïvodji — ETS Montreal\n\n\nRushabh Solanki — U of Waterloo\n\n\nMeghana Bhange — ETS Montreal\n\n\nPrakhar Ganesh — McGill\n\n\nKhaoula Chehbouni — McGill\n\n\nParth Sarin — Stanford\n\n\nAfif Taik — Université de Sherbrooke\n\n\nJoachim Baumann — University of Zurich\n\n\nSara Fish — Harvard\n\n\nQing Xiao — CMU\n\n\nEtienne Gauthier — Inria\n\n\nJulien Ferry — Polytechnique Montreal\n\n\nHeber Hwang Arcolezi — Inria\n\n\nPatrik Kenfack — ETS Montreal\n\n\nHarry Cheon — UCSD\n\n\nMeredith Stewart — UCSD\n\n\nShreyas Kadekodi — UCSD\n\n\nBlair Attard-Frost — U of Toronto\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\nReviewer Volunteer Form\nIf you would like to help as a reviewer, please fill out the form below.\n\nReviewer self-nomination form\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBaumann, Joachim, and Celestine Mendler-Dünner. 2024. “Algorithmic Collective Action in Recommender Systems: Promoting Songs by Reordering Playlists.” In The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. https://openreview.net/forum?id=wGjSbaMsop.\n\n\nBen-Dov, Omri, Jake Fawkes, Samira Samadi, and Amartya Sanyal. 2024. “The Role of Learning Algorithms in Collective Action.” In Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning, edited by Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Zico Kolter, Katherine Heller, Adrian Weller, Nuria Oliver, Jonathan Scarlett, and Felix Berkenkamp, 235:3443–61.
