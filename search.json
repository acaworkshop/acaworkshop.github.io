    "text": "We invite submissions to the NeurIPS Workshop on Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA). This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and community stakeholders to explore how coordinated actions of participants can shape and improve algorithmic sociotechnical systems.\nWe look forward to your submissions and to building a vibrant community around algorithmic collective action!\n\n\n\nSubmission Deadline: August 22, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\nNotification: September 19, 2025\nWorkshop: December 6/7 2025\n\n\n\n\nWe welcome both theoretical and empirical contributions that advance our understanding of algorithmic collective action. Publications are non-archival; we explicitly encourage work in progress and contributions from other fields. If you submit work on related machine learning topics, please make explicit how your insights are releavnt for the workshop; fit is an important selection criterion.\n\nSubmission portal: OpenReview\n\nPapers should be 4-6 content pages and formatted according to the following style file neurips_ACA_2025. Submissions should be anonymized to ensure a double-blind peer review process. Authors are encouraged to work through the NeurIPS paper checklist but it is not mandatory to include the checklist with the workshop submission.\nFor non-standard workshop contributions, that do not fit with the above format (e.g., software tools, experience reports, grassroots initiatives, or non-academic participation), we engourage authors to reach out to us at acaworkshop2025@gmail.com and we will figure out an appropriate format for these cases individually.\n\n\n\nWe welcome contributions that explore the mechanisms, challenges, opportunities, and impacts of collective efforts to influence algorithmic systems. Submissions may include technical insights, interdisciplinary perspectives, lived experiences, or original ideas that help advance and shape the future of the emerging field of algorithmic collective action.\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nCollective goals and strategies: Strategies for purposefully interacting with algorithmic systems to achieve socially beneficial outcomes. Examples include data obfuscation for protecting user privacy, conscious data contributions to promote market competition, data strikes to resist surveillance and data manipulation to achieve fairness. This could also mean to revisit ideas from data poisoning and adversarial machine learning or to repurpose optimization algorithms for the collective good.\nAttack surfaces of AI systems: What are the levers that a collective can exploit in the age of AI?\nSuccess bounds: What kinds of collective goals are realistically achievable? This includes statistical bounds, learning-theoretic insights, and optimization-based results.\nCoordination: What are the challenges of organizing large-scale collective action? Examples include information sharing, tools for participant orchestration, strategies for coordination and other practical considerations.\nEconomic aspects: Mechanism design for incentivizing participation, analysis of strategic behavior, competing incentives, and equilibrium outcomes.\nCountermeasures: Robust learning under coordinated data manipulation; trade-offs in defending against collective strategies.\nAI Governance and Advocacy, Participatory AI: Community-driven approaches to AI design, regulation and oversight. How can stakeholders participate meaningfully in shaping AI systems?\nPower dynamics on online platforms: How platform design and control affect collective efforts and user agency.\n\nWe also welcome case studies, community perspectives as well as insights from application domains, including content creation, social media, creative work, and the gig economy more broadly."

    "text": "Despite opening up unthought opportunities for productivity and commercial development, increasingly capable algorithmic systems have also posed new threats to the well-being of their participants and lead to or exacerbated existing social issues such as biases, labor tensions (Marcin 2019; Wood and Lehdonvirta 2019), and erosion of privacy (Papernot et al. 2018). As a result, those who interact with algorithmic systems have led coordinated campaigns to shape the systems directly or pressure the operators to indirectly implement changes to the systems. Real world examples include the #DeclineNow campaign by Doordash gig workers to increase pay by collectively witholding labor, the use of coordinated “No AI Art” posts by artists on DeviantArt to voice their grievances to the platform, and the coordinated migration of users from X (Twitter) to BlueSky. We refer to (Sigg, Hardt, and Mendler-Dünner 2025) for a living survey of docmumented use cases. These bottom-up efforts demonstrate the organic interests of workers, consumers, and citizens in shaping and pushing back against algorithmic systems.\nThe study of “collective action” has a long history in Economics and Sociology as a way for groups of people to impact markets and the political arena (Olson 1965; Marwell and Oliver 1993). Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA) is the study of such coordination strategies in algorithmically-mediated sociotechnical systems. Following early explorations in HCI and Computational Social Science (Postmes and Brunsting 2002; Turner et al. 2005; Li et al. 2018), ACA has recently emerged as an exciting new topic for rigorous theoretical and empirical work within Machine Learning (Kulynych et al. 2020; Hardt et al. 2023; Ben-Dov et al. 2024; Baumann and Mendler-Dünner 2024; Gauthier, Bach, and Jordan 2025; Solanki et al. 2025). Initial findings demonstrate how the expertise of the ML community in algorithm design and optimization can be used, not only to build increasingly powerful systems, but also to enable community participation and counter power centralization though the conscious use of data interfaces in AI systems. Moreover, the user-centric perspective of ACA complements the many ongoing efforts of building “fair”, “participatory”, and “responsible” AI systems from within firms.\nOur workshop offers a platform to discuss new ideas and help define the foundational research directions for this emerging topic through interdisciplinary discussions between core ML researchers, scholars from the social sciences, community stakeholders and advocates. We will invite speakers and panelists involved in organizing communities to share practical insights and real world challenges, as well as researchers exploring related technical questions within the core ML community. Ultimately our goal is to build a lasting community and promote exciting opportunities for new research, centering the needs of consumers and workers in the study of AI systems.\n\n\n\n\nBaumann, Joachim, and Celestine Mendler-Dünner. 2024. “Algorithmic Collective Action in Recommender Systems: Promoting Songs by Reordering Playlists.” In The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. https://openreview.net/forum?id=wGjSbaMsop.\n\n\nBen-Dov, Omri, Jake Fawkes, Samira Samadi, and Amartya Sanyal. 2024. “The Role of Learning Algorithms in Collective Action.” In Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning, edited by Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Zico Kolter, Katherine Heller, Adrian Weller, Nuria Oliver, Jonathan Scarlett, and Felix Berkenkamp, 235:3443–61.
